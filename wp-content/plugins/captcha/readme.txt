This plugin allows you to implement super security captcha form into web forms. 

== Description ==

The Captcha plugin allows you to implement a super security captcha form into web forms. It protects your website from spam by means of math logic, easily understood by human beings. You will not have to spend your precious time on annoying attempts to understand hard-to-read words, combinations of letters or pictures that make your eyes pop up. All you need is to do one of the three basic maths actions - add, subtract and multiply.
This captcha can be used for login, registration, password recovery, comments forms.
There is also a premium version of the plugin, allowing compatibility with BuddyPress (Registration form, Comments form, "Create a Group" form) and Contact Form 7.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Missing CAPTCHA on the comment form? = 

You might have a theme where comments.php is not coded properly. 

Wopdpress version matters. 

(WP2 series) Your theme must have a tag `<?php do_action('comment_form', $post->ID); ?>` inside the file `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`. 
Most WP2 themes already have it. The best place to put this tag is before the comment textarea, you can move it up if it is below the comment textarea.

(WP3 series) WP3 has a new function comment_form inside of `/wp-includes/comment-template.php`. 
Your theme is probably not up-to-date to call that function from comments.php.
WP3 theme does not need the code line `do_action('comment_form'`... inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php`.
Instead it uses a new function call inside of comments.php: `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
If you have WP3 and captcha is still missing, make sure your theme has `<?php comment_form(); ?>`
inside of `/wp-content/themes/[your_theme]/comments.php` (please check the Twenty Ten theme's comments.php for proper example)

= I would like to add Captcha to the custom form on my website. How can I do this? =

1. Install the Captcha plugin and activate it.
2. Open the file with the form (where you would like to add captcha to).
3. Find a place to insert the code for the captcha output.
4. Insert the necessary lines: 

`if( function_exists( 'cptch_display_captcha_custom' ) ) { echo "<input type='hidden' name='cntctfrm_contact_action' value='true' />"; echo cptch_display_captcha_custom() } ;`

If the form is HTML you should insert the line with the PHP tags:

`<?php if( function_exists( 'cptch_display_captcha_custom' ) ) { echo "<input type='hidden' name='cntctfrm_contact_action' value='true' />"; echo cptch_display_captcha_custom(); } ?>`

5. Then you should add the lines to the function of the entered data checking  

`if( function_exists( 'cptch_check_custom_form' ) && cptch_check_custom_form() !== true ) echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA."`

or

`<?php if( function_exists( 'cptch_check_custom_form' ) && cptch_check_custom_form() !== true ) echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA." ?>`

You could add this line to the variable and display this variable in the required place instead of `echo "Please complete the CAPTCHA."`. If there is a variable (responsible for the errors output) in the check function, this phrase can be added to this variable. If the function returns 'true', it means that you have entered captcha properly. In all other cases the function will return 'false'.

= Can I move the Captcha block in the comment form? =

It depends on the comments form. If the hook call by means of which captcha works (after_comment_field or something like this) is present in the file comments.php, you can change captcha positioning by moving this hook call.

Please find the file 'comments.php' in the theme and change position of the line `do_action( 'comment_form_after_fields' );` or any similar line - place it under the Submit button.
In case there is no such hook in the comments file of your theme, then, unfortunately, this option is not available.

= How to change a captcha title =

You should go to the Settings page and change the value in the 'Title for CAPTCHA in the form' field.

= During the settings saving I get the error: 'Please select one item in the block Arithmetic and Complexity for CAPTCHA'. What is this? =

For stable work of the Captcha plugin you should select at least one item in the 'Arithmetic actions for CAPTCHA' block and select 'CAPTCHA complexity level' on the Settings page, because math expression should consist of at least 1 math sign and parts of math expression should be displayed like words or numbers or both of them.

= I have some problems with the plugin's work. What Information should I provide to receive proper support? =

Please make sure that the problem hasn't been discussed yet on our forum (<a href="http://support.bestwebsoft.com" target="_blank">http://support.bestwebsoft.com</a>). If no, please provide the following data along with your problem's description:

2. the name of the plugin and its version. If you are using a pro version - your order number.
3. the version of your WordPress installation
